# Alfred Agent Start (Minimal)

Use this file when an agent starts with minimal context.

## Must Read Next

1. `agent/start.md`
2. `docs/product-context.md`
3. `docs/engineering-standards.md`
4. For iOS/front-end issues: `docs/ui-spec.md`

## Auth Direction (Current)

1. Phase I auth is migrating to Clerk (epic `#52`).
2. New auth work should follow issues `#53`, `#54`, and `#56`.
3. Breaking auth changes are acceptable at this phase.
4. Remove or hard-disable legacy custom `/v1/auth/ios/session*` flow.

## LLM Backend Direction (Current)

1. Backend assistant direction is LLM-first with OpenRouter provider routing.
2. Migration execution queue is GitHub issues `#91` through `#103` (`ai-backend` label).
3. Legacy rule-based assistant logic was removed (`#91`) and must not be reintroduced.

## Assistant Routing Direction (Current)

1. Semantic planner migration is tracked in `#180` and implemented.
2. Planner-driven routing (schema-constrained) is the required primary path.
3. Current policy is English-first; non-English routes to safe clarification until expanded.

## Execution Rule

1. GitHub issues with `phase-1` are the execution source of truth (`P0` before `P1`).
