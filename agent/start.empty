# Alfred Agent Start (Minimal)

Use this file when an agent starts with minimal context.

## Must Read Next

1. `agent/start.md`
2. `docs/product-context.md`
3. `docs/engineering-standards.md`

## Auth Direction (Current)

1. Phase I auth is migrating to Clerk (epic `#52`).
2. New auth work should follow issues `#53`, `#54`, and `#56`.
3. Breaking auth changes are acceptable at this phase.
4. Remove or hard-disable legacy custom `/v1/auth/ios/session*` flow.

## Execution Rule

1. GitHub issues with `phase-1` are the execution source of truth (`P0` before `P1`).
